01. Intro - homology search
02. Intro - profiles
03. Intro - HMMs and CMs
04. Intro - Rmark
05. QDB
06. HMM filters
07. 2008/2009 Then HMMs got a lot faster.
    MSV filter slide (JSSS)
08. Swapping out old HMM filters for new ones would make little
    difference, since post-filtering CM dominates running time.
09. SWITCH GEARS to SSU alignment.
SSU ALIGNMENT
    - HMM banding
    - Post prob masking
HOMOLOGY SEARCH
    - updated Rmark
- ? Actual results (Stadler Tedious Task of RNA homology search) Benasque ?


----------------
To do.

-- generally reduce words (Gutell benchmark set)

-- between manual and probability based masked, add one of the example
   sequences/structures shown earlier, and show it's PPs (if you can
   find one that has non-blue here) as an example.
   From user guide: M21529 is a possibility
   And possibly follow up with a PP diagram summarizing a BIG
   alignemnt (the one used for determining archaeal masK?)




-- Spice up second CM-HMM filter slide, to show HMM banding can be
   used, and that new HMM filter is HMMER3. Add smaller image for HMM
   banding at bottom. And change filtering slide.

-- Spice up last two slides.
   Infernal is foundation for a lot of RNA sequence analysis tools:

   Infernal underneath Rfam, which is underneath RNACentral
   Infernal underneath RDP
   Infernal underneath SSU-ALIGN, which is underneath Greengenes
   Infernal underneath EBI metagenomics portal
   Infernal underneath ??
   ? HMMER underneath Infernal
   ?? Easel underneath HMMER
   ??? Easel underneath Xfam/Pfam

-- should I get rid of second slide with 100Kb, on low res displays
   the tRNA doesn't even show up...

-- last line on first text slide is awkward... Homologous genes often
   share... Is it necessary? If so, I need to really know how to
   deliver that line... I stumbled over it in practice.
   
-- fix 4 structures in struct prof info slide

-- Wheres the loop slide still too wordy AND FLIP THE STRUCTURE! so
   itn mirrors the states

-- QDB highlight gamma and transition probabilities

Unsure if these are necessary:
-- make a slide comparing QDB to HMM banding, and showing that while
   QDB restricts 1D of the matrix, HMM restricts 2.

Pretty sure these are not necessary:
-- REDO all timings for first part of talk (v1.0: QDB, HMM filters,
   combined) consider swapping out Brown ROC slides for fig 4.4, which uses
   Infernal 1.01 (19.0 hours instead of 50).

In progress:
-- Get non-banded timing of SSU alignment benchmark to compare to 1.1
   banded (can I do this with 1.1? --small).


DONE:
-- Add Fig 1 from Genome Annotation book chapter before avgscores
   slide, this will ease the explanation of avg scores.
-- very awkward explaining extra complexity for CMs versus HMMs... is
   this necessary?
-- after blank slide -- is first slide necessary? Can I just verbally
   mention SSU rRNA and then go into next slide?
-- if we remove that slide, need to mention that Infernal takes 10
   minutes to do 1 sequence.
-- reduce text at top on masking intro slide   
-- Remove "Goals of alignment program" from second seq2tree slide
-- fix second seq2tree fig
-- get rid of SSU-ALIGN tutorial line.
-- Fix final ROC slide, nhmmer should not be orange, 1.0.2 needs to be
   on there.
-- Replace 'N's in tRNA qdb slide with actual sequence
-- add Infernal 1.0 miniapp paper to before HMMER3 mention.
-- add non-badned run time for CM alignmetn of SSU
-- update seq counts in SSU databases
-- fix 'by chance' in seq profile info slide.



TIMINGS
EPN, Wed Aug 13 20:14:56 2014: 47.5 minutes up to masking
EPN, Wed Aug 13 20:24:36 2014: 56.7 minutes FIN
Really want to get it shorter, so I don't feel like I have to
rush. What can I remove/shorten?
      - QDB section? remove beta slide?

Went slower this time.
EPN, Fri Aug 15 10:37:21 2014 32.25 minutes up to HMMER3
EPN, Fri Aug 15 10:52:50 2014 46    minutes up to masking
EPN, Fri Aug 15 11:02:53 2014 56    minutes FIN
