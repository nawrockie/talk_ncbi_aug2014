\item 1977 - Carl Woese decided to classify all living things phylogenetically
\item needed ``\emph{a molecule of appropriately broad distribution}'' for comparative analysis
\item SSU rRNA was chosen
\begin{itemize}
  \item universally distributed
  \item highly conserved 
  \item large enough to provide sufficient data (1500-1800 nt)
  \item readily isolated

  11 in 1987, 36 in 1998, 52 in 2003, 67 in 2006...

\textbf{Probabilistic models allow direction calculation of useful quantities}

\small
\begin{itemize}
  \item Posterior decoding algorithm computes the posterior
  probability that each nucleotide is correctly aligned given the
  model
  \begin{itemize}
    \item allows HMM banding for CM alignment ($O(N^3 log(N))$ reduced
    to close to $O(N^2)$
    \item useful for identifying and removing (masking) columns that
    are not reliably aligned prior to phylogenetic inference
%    \item could be directly used during phylogenetic inference
